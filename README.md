# Dr. Santa


This was my tiny project for Christmas Holidays back in 2019. 

Nothing more than **yet another three-in-a-row**.

### The challenge:
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&#10003] complete it within a holiday break<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&#10003] draw all assets from scratch (they are heavily inspired, but still)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&#10003] Stay under 1000 lines of code
</div>

#### Notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Using [Dart](https://dart.dev/) + [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) + [Flame Engine](https://flame-engine.org/)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * I've never learned dart, but it's very similar to java<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * I've never learned flutter, but it's somewhat similar to react<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Still, the code is a mess of hacks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Optimized for the sceen-size of iphone 7.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * This work inspired me to draw some [pixel-art](https://www.deviantart.com/bugzmanov/gallery) for fun
